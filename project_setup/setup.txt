        - Create a `members` collection if it does not already exist.
        - Import the `members.json` file (located in the `project_setup` folder) into this collection.
        - This member will be your admin. Default password is `112233` and the mobile number is `6110011001` if already not present.
        - Add this member's `_id` to the `.env` file as `ADMIN_ID`.
